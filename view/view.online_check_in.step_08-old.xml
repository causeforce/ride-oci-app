You can use the Instant Self-Pledge button below to process payment for this donation immediately, or you can use the Delayed Self-Pledge button to commit to paying this amount at a later time.
		
		Please note that everyone who has not personally raised $1500 is required to check-in in person on Saturday morning prior to joining the OneWalk event.
		
		Due to team fundraising, those walkers who have not met their individual fundraising minimum by Saturday morning, will have their eligibility to walk calculated based on their teamâ€™s fundraising totals. If your team has not raised sufficient funds to get you to $1500, you will be required to turn in additional donations or complete a Delayed Self Pledge in order to walk.
		
		Confirm your place by raising at least $1500 in personal fundraising prior to Saturday September 12, 2015.]]></english>
